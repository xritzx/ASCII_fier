# ASCII_fier

An image is converted into its B&W version and then it is represented by a bunch of ASCII characters.
eg. White can be represented by '.' or ' ' and Black can be represented by '@' or '$'

```
git clone https://github.com/xritzx/ASCII_fier.git
cd ASCII_fier
python ASCII-fier.py
```
Choose your image file and it will generate an .html file for the ascii pic.
### Make sure you have easygui, numpy, opencv installed
